Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All the models labeled Dog_01 as tibetan terrier and chrysanthemum dog, while the correct answer is tibetan terrier, so while one of the labels is correct, other is not


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, Once again this result is consistent for all models which classified Dog_02 as blenheim spaneil when it is a tibetan terrier


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: all the three models could not classify Horse_01 correctly, vgg reported it as a great dane,resnet reports it as a sorrel and alexnet labeled it an oxcart


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.
Answer:All the models performed equally on all statistical metrics of this project within similar periods of time, apart from that all the three models equally misclassified Horse_01 and Dog_02, so all the models performed equally well, but to break the tie, since vgg has a run time of 00:59:56 compared to 00:59:59 of resnet and alexnet, I will pick vgg as the best model.
